# BudgetSpoonSolo
This project is a dynamic web application which allows users to search for restaurants in the Detroit area.
Users can specify their budget, which meal they would like, and how many diners will be dining.
Then the app provides results according to the specifications of the user.
The app provides the average price of meals at restaurants and provides appropriate restaurants according to the average meal prices.
